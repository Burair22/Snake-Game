# Snake-Game
This is my First Year Uni project. The Project aims to develop a classic Snake Game with the use of Java Swing where player can control the snake to eat apples. The project is a GUI based project which will make it user friendly and interactive for users. The game allows the developer to show case their skills with the use of OOPs concepts in Java.
